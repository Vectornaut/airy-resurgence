# Resurgence of the Airy function and other exponential integrals

## To-do list

### Conventions
- (Veronica) Change the computation with Sauzin to be in line with convention
- (Aaron) Finish switching the Airy and Airy-Lucas sections to the literature sign convention
### Proofreading
- (Aaron) Proofread copied-in sections about Laplace transform
- (Aaron) Check the Bessel equation in the spatial domain that corresponds to the Airy-Lucas equation in the frequency domain
- (Aaron) Look over general modified Bessel example
### General results
- Prove Theorem 2 (from outline)
### Examples
- Airy-Lucas
  - (Aaron) Plot &Lambda;<sup>(k)</sup> contours
  - (Aaron) Copy the hypergeomtric function identity used in the contour argument into an appendix
  - ~(Veronica) Copy in asymptotic analysis~
  - Show how the proof of Theorem 2 works by going through it in this special case
    - (Veronica) Construct *W̃*<sub>1</sub> and *W̃*<sub>&minus;1</sub> in the "Asymptotic analysis" section
    - (Aaron) Revise the "Borel regularity" section to mirror the proof of Theorem 2
    - (Aaron) Confirm the uniqueness argument by showing explicitly that ṽ<sub>1</sub> sums to a multiple of v<sub>1</sub>
- General modified Bessel
  - (Aaron) Plot contours
  - (*unassigned*) Generalize the differential equation argument used for Airy-Lucas
- (Aaron) Add vibrating beam example
- Fix mistaken coefficients in hyper-Airy 5 example
  - (Aaron) Check over the Sage notebook that gave the coefficients in the current draft
  - (both) Compare with the Mathematica notebook that gives different coefficients
### Comparisons
- ~(Veronica) Write out the comparison with Mariño in the desired way~
