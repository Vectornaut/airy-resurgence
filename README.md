# Resurgence of the Airy function and other exponential integrals

## To-do list

### Conventions
- (Veronica) Change the computation with Sauzin to be in line with convention
- (Aaron) Finish switching the Airy and Airy-Lucas sections to the literature sign convention
### Proofreading
- (Aaron) Proofread copied-in sections about Laplace transform
- (Aaron) Check the Bessel equation in the spatial domain that corresponds to the Airy-Lucas equation in the frequency domain
### Examples
- (Aaron) Add vibrating beam example
- Fix mistaken coefficients in hyper-Airy 5 example
  - (Aaron) Check over the Sage notebook that gave the coefficients in the current draft
  - (both) Compare with the Mathematica notebook that gives different coefficients
### Comparisons
- (Veronica) Write out the comparison with Mari√±o in the desired way
