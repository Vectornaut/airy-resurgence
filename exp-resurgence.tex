\subsubsection{Setting}
You can often find a formal power series
\[ \series{\Phi} = z^\sigma \left( \frac{c_0}{z} + \frac{c_1}{z^2} + \frac{c_2}{z^3} + \frac{c_3}{z^4} + \ldots \right), \]
with $\sigma \in [0, 1)$, that looks or acts like a solution to a problem whose actual solutions are holomorphic functions of $z$. For example, you might rewrite the integral

\begin{itemize}
\item You can often find a formal power series $\tilde{\Phi} = \ldots$ that looks or acts like a solution to a problem whose actual solutions are holomorphic functions of $z$. For example\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item Exponential integral: na\"{i}ve saddle point expansion.
\item ODE: formal solution. Existence theorem in \cite{diverg-resurg-iii}?
\item Feynman diagram series?
\end{itemize}
\item Once you have $\tilde{\Phi}$, you might try applying {\em Borel summation}, which turns a formal power series into a function asymptotic to it.
\begin{itemize}
\item Borel summation work in three steps. First we turn the formal power series $\tilde{\Phi}$ \textcolor{magenta}{[$\tilde{\Phi}(z)$]} in the ``frequency variable'' $z$ into a formal power series $\tilde{\phi}$ in a new ``position variable'' $\zeta$.
\item The series $\tilde{\phi}$ turns out to have a positive radius of convergence, so it defines a holomorphic function $\hat{\phi}$. By analytic continuation, we can expand the domain of $\hat{\phi}$ to a Riemann surface $B$ with a distinguished 1-form $\lambda$---the continuation of $d\zeta$.
\item If $\hat{\phi}$ grows slowly enough along an infinite ray $\Gamma_b^\theta := b + e^{i\theta}[0, \infty)$ \textcolor{magenta}{[decide notation]}, its Laplace transform $\laplace_b^\theta \hat{\phi} := \ldots$ is a holomorphic function of $z$, well-defined on some sector of the frequency plane. In this case, we say $\tilde{\Phi}$ is {\em Borel-summable}, and we call $\laplace_b^\theta \hat{\phi}$ its {\em Borel sum} at $b$.
\item {[Draw the square!]}
\end{itemize}
\item Different functions can be asymptotic to the same power series, and Borel summation picks one of them.
\item In many cases, it picks correctly, producing an actual solution to your problem.
\begin{itemize}
\item The question of how that happens is the starting point for this paper.
\item (In both of the cases that we study, the Borel sum of $\tilde{\Phi}$ is always taken at a zero of $\lambda$, rather than an arbitrary point in $B$. For ODEs, our treatment explains why the zeroes of $\lambda$ play a special role.)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item The central goal of this paper is to lay out two kinds of problems where we can prove that the Borel sum of a formal power series solution is always an actual solution.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first problem is evaluating a certain kind of exponential integral: a one-dimensional {\em thimble integral}.
\item The second problem is solving a certain kind of ODE.
\item These two problems are closely linked. By playing with derivatives of an exponential integral, you can often find a linear ODE that the integral satisfies. Conversely, for many classical ODEs, there are useful bases of exponential integral solutions.
\item \textcolor{magenta}{(Does this touch the Picard-Lefshetz perspective? Betti / de Rham relationship: ODE is a connection, and exponential integrals give flat sections?)}
\end{itemize}
\item Clearly separate the parts of the theory that deal with holomorphic functions and formal power series.
\item (Super-motivation: why do the zeroes of $\lambda$ play a special role?) As part of the treatment, we've made use of some new perspectives on the Laplace transform.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Geometric picture.} The spatial domain $B$ is a translation surface. If $b \in B$ is non-singular, the frequency domain for $\laplace_b^\theta$ is $T^* B_b$. If $b$ is a conical singularity, the frequency domain is more interesting, as we'll see in our main example.
\item \textbf{A new dictionary for ODEs.} The Laplace transform is often usd to solve ODEs on the frequency domain by relating them to ODEs on the spatial domain. We find, however, that it's much easier and more natural to relate ODEs on the frequency domain to integral equations on the spatial domain. This clarifies why we take the Borel sums at zeroes of $\lambda$ when we're trying to solve an ODE.
\end{itemize}
\item Illustrate with detailed treatments of several examples.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some have been discussed many times, using different approaches and conventions. We'll try to give an idea of how all these different treatments fit together. $\bullet$ The Airy function. $\bullet$ The anharmonic oscillator (Bender--Wu, Schiappa).
\item Others haven't been discussed much.
\end{itemize}
\item \textcolor{magenta}{To understand, for example, the Ecalle formalism, you can start with these toy examples, which illustrate what's going on, but can also be studied in a more elementary way. [How do we work this into the introduction?]}
\item \textcolor{magenta}{The examples give a place to compare more complicated formalisms like the Picard-Lefshetz (Morse theory) or Ecalle formalisms? [How do we work this into the introduction?]}
\end{itemize}
\color{DarkBlue}
\subsection{Why does Borel resummation work?}
Borel resummation is a way of turning a formal power series
\[ \series{\varphi} = z^\sigma \left( \frac{\varphi_0}{z} + \frac{\varphi_1}{z^2} + \frac{\varphi_2}{z^3} + \frac{\varphi_3}{z^4} + \ldots \right), \]
with $\sigma \in [0, 1)$, into a function which is asymptotic to $\series{\varphi}$ as $z \to \infty$. Different functions can be asymptotic to the same power series, and Borel resummation picks one of them, performing an implicit regularization~\textbf{[arXiv:1705.03071, or maybe arXiv:1412.6614]}. When a function matches the Borel sum of its asymptotic series, we'll say it's {\em Borel regular}. Several familiar kinds of regularity imply Borel regularity, and shed light on why it occurs.
%%Knowing that a function is Borel regular gives us extra information about it---enough to reconstruct it from its asymptotic series. What's the nature of this extra information?
%%Since different functions can be asymptotic to the same power series, Borel resummation must involve an {\em implicit regularization}, restricting its range to a class of functions which are uniquely determined by their formal power series.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Having a good asymptotic approximation}

Let $R_N$ be the difference between a function and the partial sum
\[ \frac{\varphi_0}{z} + \frac{\varphi_1}{z^2} + \frac{\varphi_2}{z^3} + \ldots + \frac{\varphi_{N-2}}{z^{N-1}} \]
of its asymptotic series. Watson showed a century ago that the function is Borel regular whenever there's a constant $c \in (0, \infty)$ with
\[ |R_N| \le \frac{c^{N+1} N!}{|z|^N} \]
over all orders $N$ and all $z$ in a wide enough wedge around infinity.
\item \textbf{Satisfying a singular differential equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Think about conditions where this works.
\item Maybe the correct place is the setting of Ecalle's formal integral. See \S 5.2.2.1 of Delabaere's {\em Divergent Series, Summability and Resurgence III}.
\item Say there's a unique solution (up to scaling) that shrinks as you go right; everything else blows up exponentially. Then this is the only solution that can be expressed as a Laplace transform.
\item If the Borel-transformed equation has a subexponential solution $\hat{f}$ which is ``shifted holomorphic'' (we called this having a ``fractional power singularity'' in {\tt airy-resurgence}), then $\laplace \hat{f}$ satisfies the original equation, because there are no boundary terms.
\item Draw diagram showing formal vs. holomorphic solutions in time vs. frequency domains.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Being a thimble integral}

Let $X$ be a translation surface---a Riemann surface carrying a holomorphic 1-form $\nu$. Suppose $X$ is of {\em meromorphic type}, meaning that we got it by puncturing a compact Riemann surface $\overline{X}$ at finitely many points, and $\nu$ has a pole at each puncture. A {\em translation coordinate} on $X$ is a local coordinate whose derivative is $\nu$.

Take another meromorphic-type translation surface $B$ and a holomorphic Morse\footnote{This condition means that the critical points of $f$ are isolated (the compactness of $\overline{X}$ guarantees this) and the 2-jet of $f$ is non-zero at every critical point.} map $f \maps \overline{X} \to \overline{B}$ \textcolor{magenta}{that sends punctures to punctures [actually, don't require this; the Orr--Sommerfeld integrals, for example, don't satisfy it]}. Suppose every singularity of $B$ is a critical value of $f$. \textbf{[Typical usage of ``Borel plane'' seems ambiguous, so maybe we can use ``Borel plane'' for $B$ and ``Borel cover'' for the Riemann surface of the Borel-transformed series. How to handle the Orr–Sommerfeld functions (DLMF~\S 9.13)? We know $f = 4u^3 - 3u$ is the pullback of a translation coordinate, but we also need a puncture at $f(0)$\ldots]} For each critical point $p$, let $\Gamma_p$ be the ray going rightward from $f(p)$, and let $\zeta_p$ be the translation coordinate around $\Gamma_p$ which vanishes at $f(p)$. These are well-defined as long as $\Gamma_p$ misses the critical values of $f$. The preimage $f^{-1}(\Gamma_p)$ is a bunch of disjoint curves, as long as $\Gamma_p$ misses the other critical values of $f$. The {\em Lefschetz thimble} $\Lambda_p$ is the component of $f^{-1}(\Gamma_p)$ that goes through $p$, oriented so that shifting it to its left would make its projection run clockwise around $\Gamma_p$. The {\em thimble integral}
\[ I_p = \int_{\Lambda_p} e^{-z f^*\zeta_p} \nu \]
is a holomorphic function on the right half-plane parametrized by $z$, and it turns out \textbf{[we hope]} to be Borel regular.

\textbf{[Talk about exponential integrals and their decomposition into thimble integrals.]}

In higher-dimensional complex manifolds, integrals over Lefschetz thimbles are still Borel regular~\textbf{[``Exponential integrals, Lefschetz thimbles and linear resurgence''][``Exponential Integral'' lectures?]}. This fact plays an important technical role in quantum mechanics, where infinite-dimensional exponential integrals are supposed to give the expectation values of observable quantities. Physicists often use Borel summation and related techniques to assign values to these integrals \textbf{[Costin \& Kruskal, ``On optimal truncation...'']}.

\color{Turquoise}
Choose a path $\gamma \maps \R \to X$ whose projection $f \circ \gamma$ starts out going leftward out of a puncture, ends up going rightward into a puncture, and never touches a critical value of $f$. Choose a translation coordinate $\zeta$ on $B$ and continue it along $f \circ \gamma$, noting that it may become multi-valued if $f \circ \gamma$ intersects itself. This data defines the {\em exponential integral}
\[ I = \int_\gamma e^{-z f^*\zeta} \nu, \]
a holomorphic function on the right half-plane parametrized by $z$. It turns out \textbf{[we hope]} that we can get $I$ by summing $e^{-\alpha_p z} I_p$ over various critical points---as long as none of the $\Gamma_p$ run into each other. \textbf{[We get jumps at phases where the $\Gamma_p$ do hit each other.]} The constants $\alpha_p$ are values of $\zeta$, continued to the critical points along certain paths.
\color{black}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each resummation method for asymptotic series makes some implicit assumption that allows us to reconstruct a holomorphic function from its asymptotic behaviour.
\item The resummation method works correctly for functions which satisfy that assumption.
\item For the modified Bessel function $K_{1/3}$, Borel resummation works because the asymptotic series encodes a second-order differential equation.
\begin{itemize}
\item Different aspects of this example appear in various places (Mari\~{n}o, Kawai--Takei, Sauzin). We give a detailed, unified treatment.
\end{itemize}
\item We can generalize this argument to all $K_\nu$ with $\nu \in \mathbb{Q}$.
\item We can also generalize to all third-order exponential integrals.
\begin{itemize}
\item Most of them are equivalent to the $K_{1/3}$ integral, but there's also an interesting degeneration.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\color{black}
\subsection{Fractional derivative formula}
\begin{itemize}
\item Theorem~\ref{thm:three-halves} says that for a certain class of exponential integrals
\[ I(z) = \int_\Gamma e^{-zf}\;\nu, \]
the inverse Laplace \textbf{[better to say Borel?]} transform is the $\tfrac{3}{2}$ derivative of $d\zeta/df$, where $f^* d\zeta = \nu$ \textbf{[check]}.
\item the asymptotic expansion of $I(z)$ is a resurgent function.
\item Is it always a \emph{simple} resurgent function?
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Maxim belies it is in general, and indeed in our examples we get simple resurgent functions. But how to prove it in general?}
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Stokes phenomenon}
\begin{itemize}
\item For Bessel functions, we can see explicitly how solutions jump when the Laplace transform angle crosses a critical value.
\item The jump comes from the branch cut difference identity for hypergeometric functions.
\item Possible interpretation of the Stokes factors as intersections numbers in Morse--Novikov theory \textbf{[ask Maxim]}
\end{itemize}
\section{The Laplace and Borel transforms}
\subsection{The Laplace transform}
\begin{itemize}
\item Action on differential equations.
\begin{itemize}
\item Can we find a way to prove this when the differential operator spits out a function that's not integrable around zero?
\end{itemize}
\item Global picture?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Borel transform}
\begin{itemize}
\item Action on differential equations.
\begin{itemize}
\item No inhomogeneous terms! How is this consistent with the Laplace transform's action? Is there always an inhomogeneous solution with subexponential asymptotics?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Third-order exponential integrals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce to
\[ I(z) = \int \exp\left[-z\big(u^3 + pu + q)\right]\,du \]
using change of coordinate.
\item When $p \neq 0$, can reduce further to
\[ I(z) = p^{1/2} e^{-qz} K_{1/3}(p^{3/2} z). \]
\item As $p$ goes to zero, $I(z)$ degenerates to
\[ \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2/3} e^{-qz} \Gamma(\tfrac{1}{3}) z^{-1/3} = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2/3} e^{-qz} \laplace_{\zeta,0}(\zeta^{-2/3}) = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2/3} \laplace_{\zeta_{-q},q}(\zeta^{-2/3}). \]

\item Show that we can find a slight solution at each critical value.
\item Show that $\hat{\iota} = \tilde{\iota}$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I = \laplace \iota$
\item $\hat{\iota}$ is the Taylor expansion of $\iota$
\item $\tilde{I}$ is the asymptotic series of $I$
\item $\tilde{\iota} = \borel \tilde{I}$
\item Idea: Show that $\hat{\iota}$ and $\tilde{\iota}$ have matching asymptotics at $\zeta = 0$. Since they both satisfy the position-domain integral equation, they must coincide.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item General thimble integral (conditions?)
\begin{itemize}
\item Proof of Borel regularity
\item $3/2$-derivative formula
\item Contour argument
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Resurgence
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how Borel regularity relates resurgence of formal series to resurgence of holomorphic functions in the position domain. \textcolor{gray}{think more about what we're trying to say here}
\item Relate to Ecalle's formalism and the alien derivative
\item Stokes factors
\begin{itemize}
\item For ODEs
\item For thimble integrals
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Examples \textcolor{gray}{make sure each example contains a computation of the Borel transform, so we can see it matches}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Airy example
\begin{itemize}
\item $I(z)$ is a solution of a linear ODE. We explicitly find its Borel transform, knowing the nature of singularities and the asymptotic behaviour of a basis of solution for the ODE  [{\tt airy-resurgence}]
\item Compute Stokes constants
\begin{itemize}
\item Using fractional derivative formula and Borel transform computation [{\tt draft2}]
\item Using Picard-Lefschetz theory (Pham, Kontsevich, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\item Comparison with the literature \textcolor{gray}{has to be done}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mari\~{n}o
\item Sauzin
\item Kontsevich slides
\item Kawai--Takei? [might take too long to understand well enough]
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item The Airy--Lucas examples
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute Borel transform [{\tt airy-resurgence}]
\item Compute Stokes constants \textcolor{gray}{has to be done}
\end{itemize}
\item Bessel 0 (it is different because we have infinite cover)
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute Stokes constants [{\tt draft2}]
\end{itemize}
\item Bessel $\mu$ (follows from Bessel 0)
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute Stokes constants [{\tt modified Bessel}]
\end{itemize}
\item The generalized Airy example
\item The vibrating beam example
\begin{itemize}
\item In addition to the simple example, maybe we can do an example where the equation on the spatial domain includes fractional integrals, since Andy is interested in that sort of thing
